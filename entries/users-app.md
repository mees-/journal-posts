Happy liberation day to all my fellow dutch people. Today, the fifth of may, is
when we celebrate that we've been freed from war. Normally I'd be going to one
of the (free) fesitvals that are organised each year, but this year that won't
be an option. So instead I might watch some streams that are organised as a
replacement or maybe (digitally) hang out with some friends. Maybe I'll build a
thing.

Since I wrote my last post I've been thinking of things I can build. One of
the things that I came up with is an app. A simple app that has some users and
some passwords. It doesn't need those users to do anything special,
just let them login in securely.

The catch is that I want to use [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and
[GraphQl](https://graphql.org/) in it. I think it'll be fun and a good excercise
to just build a really simple app that has secure login and a database, just
like you would when building a real, production app. I really want to learn
JWT and graphql and I think this could be a good way to do it.

I'll let you know how it went when (if) I'm done making it.
