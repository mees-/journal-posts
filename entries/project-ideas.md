I think that because of getting back into actually coding with this project I
might tryy and do some more projects sometime, hopefully soon. This entry will
be a living list of projects or stuff that I want to use in a project.

I've also been doing some Google analytics and search console things. While I
don't love Google for tracking me, they make cool software. SEO is something I
haven't really done anything with before. I've looked into it a little bit but
most of it is done by a gatsby plugin that generates a manifest together with an
existing file from the template that I started with that automatically generates
<code>meta</code> header tags.

Anyways, what follows is a list of things I want to do or work with:

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
- [GraphQl](https://graphql.org/) (more than just gatsby)
- Work with [Mollie](https://www.mollie.com/en/)

I'll let you know if I do anything and I'll keep updating the list when I
think of more things I want to do.
