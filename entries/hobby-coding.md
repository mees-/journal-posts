Coding when I'm home.

Unfortunately, it's not really something I do anymore. While I've been using my
mac more and more at home, instead of my desktop pc, I don't actually use it to
write code anymore.

I think I've just been way to busy, I still enjoy coding and I really hope I can
rekindle some of my passion for hobby projects. For a while now I've been
daydreaming of building a financial bookkeeping application for personal use.
The motivation here is my almost-daily use of another bookkeeping website:
twinfield.

Twinfield is close to horrible from a user experience perspective, if you ask
me. However, using it for my board job at Cleopatra has inspired me to want to
keep detailed records of my own spending. I've looked around for websites or
apps that could solve my problem but they're all either a bit too simple or
really old and bad.

I'll let you know if I manage to start building my own.
