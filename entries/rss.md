Hey there,

I'm just writing this entry to let you know that I've added an RSS feed to the
journal. you can find it at [this link](https://journal.mees.io/rss.xml).

You can use this feed to read my blog posts in your favorite RSS reader, or use
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to get my entries in your mailbox!

If you do want to use IFTTT then check out
[this applet](https://ifttt.com/applets/112937255d) that I made to email me the
new entries.
