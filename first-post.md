My first entry!  

I've build this blog application today, well actually yesterday. I built it with
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/). I knew Gatsby from projects I've done
before but I have to say it was some work to get up to speed with the whole
thing.  

I struggled with getting pages to be built from source plugins and such. The
whole platform is fairly easy to use however when you just follow the tutorial.
Which is also what I ended up doing. I also played around with some templates
before settling with the blog template and stripping it of most boilerplate it
had.

I initially wanted to develop this application for my private journal but once I
got it running and looking sort of what I want it to look like I couldn't not
publish it. And since I want to publish it it should probably have at least one
post.

That's my first post. I'll probably (hopefully) make some more improvements. One
thing I want to do is see if there's any better way to store posts. Currently I
write the post on my mac and build it into the bundle
(with <code>POST_DIR</code>) but I want to do this online and have it ci-ed.

Signing off for now,
Mees
