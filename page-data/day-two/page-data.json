I set up a better way to publish\nposts. I now have a separate git repository that is set up with\n<a href=\"https://travis-ci.com\">travis-ci</a>. Every time I push a new commit to the master\nbranch there travis-ci does a new build.</p>\n<p>Basically I have a script that travis runs that downloads the main code and uses\nit’s build script to create a build that includes the posts. Then with some\n(fairly easy) travis configuration I got it to automatically publish to Github\npages.</p>\n<p>I’ve also changed some styles on the website to make things more readable. With\nthose changes the site now has a perfect score in lighthouse. Try it out\nyourself and see some fireworks!</p>\n<p>The reason I called the project a journal and not a blog is mainly because I\nthink journal sounds cooler. As I mentioned in my previous post my main\nmotivation for the project was that I wanted a nice way to look at my private\njournal entries. I used to use <a href=\"https://dayoneapp.com/\">Day one</a> a lot and I\nliked having a place for my thoughts. Those thoughts however, were not meant to\nbe made public ever.</p>\n<p>I’ve really enjoyed creating the site and hope to be working on it some more for\na while. I have some more ideas for improvements and to make it actually\ninteresting I should probably write some more posts so the site actually has\ncontent. If you’re interested in how I made the site check out\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mees-/journal\">the repo</a>. This is not the repo the posts and\ntravis config are stored in though, thats\n<a href=\"https://github.com/mees-/journal-posts\">this one</a>. If you have any suggestions\nfeel free to submit issues or even pull requests if you want. If you submit a pr\nwith a post to the post repo I might even accept the post as a guest post.</p>\n<p>Till next time,<br>\nMees</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Day two","location":"Groningen","date":"Saturday, May 2nd 2020","time":"18:05 PM"},"excerpt":"I’ve been working some more on the blog today.
