I’ll be\nin a financial role and I’ve been preparing for a couple weeks now. The\nprospective board needs to present a plan they’ve made for their year. This plan\ndetails what strategies and leadership they will exercise in their year.</p>\n<p>Part of this plan are the financial budgets, there are two of them, one for the\nmembership side of things, which includes quarterly contribution and funding\nactivities. The other budget details the bar and drink/food sales and purchases.\nI’m in charge of the bar side of things and since I’ve been preparing and making\nthe plan for next year, I’ve also made a big complicated budget for the whole\nyear.</p>\n<p>While I can’t talk about the specifics of the budget or any financial\ninformation about Cleopatra (the society) because of a non-disclosure agreement\n, I can tell you that I’ve begun my path to excel (actually google sheets but\nwhat’s the difference) wizardry. The stuff you can do with these applications is\nvery complex and they’re essentially entire programming environments in\nthemselves. Just with the common things people want to do made especially easy.</p>\n<p>The past three days have mostly been about making the plan and budget, and I\nthink I have a presentable first version. In making the budget I’ve both talked\nto a lot of people and gotten a lot of people’s opinions. Most of people’s\nopinions were based off of calculations on historical data that either I or the\ncurrent person occupying my prospective role has made. It feels pretty good to\nbe able to give people new insights just by showing some data in different, nice\nways. It really helps to formulate new estimates if you can use clear, well\nanalysed historical data.</p>\n<p>I’m pretty happy with my budget plan that I have so far, even though it’s not a\nvery positive outlook on the next year, I believe it’s a realistic one. Because\ncorona has big effects on bars and cafe’s.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Cleopatra financially","location":"My Mom's house, Zwolle","date":"Saturday, May 23rd 2020","time":"01:05 AM"},"excerpt":"I’m (probably) going to be in the board of my student society next year.
