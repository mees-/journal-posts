But I’ve found something very interesting on Reddit.</p>\n<p>Yesterday morning I woke up in the house of one of my friend’s parents. We had\nhad a party the night before and slept over, since it’s far away from where I\nlive. As I was scrolling Reddit early in the morning I came across a post\nmentioning\n<a href=\"https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/index.html\">someone’s blog about building an OS in Rust for the RISC-V architecture</a>.\nI’ve been playing with my Arduino a little bit lately and I had also already\ncome across a project that simplifies Rust development on Arduino. I learned to\nprogram the Arduino in C (not the official Arduino C++ suite) in college two\nyears ago so I already knew a bit about bare metal programming. RISC-V was no\nArduino however, this was a much more complicated instruction set architecture\n(ISA) than the one that my Arduino runs. My Arduino, which is an Uno Rev3 runs\non an Atmega328p processor. That chip contains the flash (for storing the\nprogram), eeprom (a sort of non-volatile RAM) and it’s SRAM (actual RAM) all on\nthe same chip as it’s processor core. This is what’s known as a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_on_a_chip\">System on a Chip (SoC)</a> and it\ncombines some parts of a computer all in one chip. The Arduino actually also has\na whole other SoC, an Atmega16u2, as a co-processor which acts as a converter\nbetween the serial interface and USB, basically it handles all USB things.</p>\n<p>RISC-V is a lot more complicated than this, while also being a good stepping\nstone to keep learning more about hardware. RISC-V uses, like Atmel’s AVR, a\n<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computer\">Reduced Instruction Set Computing</a>\nISA. Which means that instead of thousands of instructions for the CPU, it has a\ncouple hundred. RISC-V supports a lot more than AVR though. To me, as a relative\nnoob (who hasn’t even completed that blog series yet), it seems one of the\nimportant differences between the two is the fact that RISC-V has an\nunprivileged mode. That means that the CPU can block or alter some of it’s\nbehaviour when foreign programs are running. Exactly like how some program I\ndownload on my laptop can’t just go and modify my entire computer and hack me.\nGranted you can get hacked, but a program can’t <em>just</em> do it. The Arduino\ndoesn’t have that and that’s why writing an OS on an Arduino isn’t as\nspectacular. Because you need to trust all the software you put on it with the\nwhole machine, you might as well write specialised software that skips having a\nkernel and OS at all.</p>\n<p>All in all I’m learning a lot about the RISC-V architecture and how kernel and\nOS development works. I’m planning to practice some of it too. I’ll probably do\nit on my Arduino, even though it isn’t really useful (as described above). I’ve\nbeen interested in systems development for some time but the blog post series is\na really good kick start to learn a lot more.<br>\nIf I do end up writing an OS for the Arduino, I’ll write another entry about it.</p>\n<p>For a short explanation of the title, MMIO is memory-mapped IO, the MMU is the\nmemory management unit, which protects the RAM from unauthorized programs and a\nHART is a hardware thread AKA processor core.</p>\n<h2>More interesting links</h2>\n<p>I’ve been researching a lot of stuff related to these topics.
