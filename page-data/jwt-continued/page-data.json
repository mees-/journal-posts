It’s\nworking and nice but I realised this is not “it”. When I started making the JWT\nservice I didn’t really know what jwt was and how it worked. I had sufficient\nunderstanding of cryptography to know what hashes and signatures were and I also\nknew the difference between symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption.</p>\n<p>What I thought though, is that JWT uses one single authoritative server to check\ntokens. This way, every time someone wants to verify a JWT they would need to\nmake another request to the authoritative server to verify the token. A much\nbetter solution to this problem is signing the token with an asymmetric key.\nThat way you can distribute your public key to everyone that wants to verify\ntokens and sign the tokens themselves with your private key. This way JWTs can\nreally replace or enhance things like Oauth that use third-party authentication\nproviders.</p>\n<p>What I realised then, is that my JWT service, which uses the HMAC algorithm to\nsign the tokens, isn’t that great to use as a microservice. A good way to\nimprove it would be to have it use an asymmetric key so that other servers can\nverify the tokens without having to make that extra request.</p>\n<p>For the goals that I had in mind though, which were to use it for a single\napplication, the best way would probably be to keep the jwt parts and the rest\nof the server together, which allows it to use HMAC and gain the performance\nbenefits that come with it.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"JWT continued","location":"Home, Groningen","date":"Tuesday, May 12th 2020","time":"10:05 AM"},"excerpt":"So recently I made my JWT service.
